# Job-application

This is a web scraper that I created while looking for a summer internships. I decided to use LinkedIn since it was the platform that I was using the most to apply for internships. This does not apply for me, I just automated the search, then I look to see if that job truly interests me and then I apply. It saved me a lot of time since searching for jobs to apply would always take forever!
